      <description>Instructions for installing the SDK are language-specific.
Go The Go SDK supports go modules. We recommend using Go 1.11 or later. You can download the sdk using:
go get -u github.com/cobaltspeech/sdk-luna/grpc/go-luna
Alternatively, if you just import github.com/cobaltspeech/sdk-luna/grpc/go-luna in your application and run go mod tidy, it will be fetched automatically.
Python The Python SDK supports installation via pip. We recommend Python 3.5 or later, and pip 19.0 or later. You can download the sdk using:</description>

      <title>Quickstart</title>

      <description>Once you have your Luna server up and running, let&amp;rsquo;s see how we can ask it to synthesize speech for some text!
First, you need to know the address (host:port) where the server is running. This document will assume the values 127.0.0.1:2727, but be sure to change those to point to your server instance. Port 2727 is the default port that the luna server binds to.
The following code snippet queries the server for a list of available voices, and uses the first listed voice to run text to speech.</description>

      <title>Mutually Authenticated TLS</title>

      <description>In our recommended default setup, TLS is enabled in the gRPC setup, and when connecting to the server, clients check the server&amp;rsquo;s SSL certificate to verify that they are talking to an authentic server. This is similar to how &amp;ldquo;https&amp;rdquo; connections work in web browsers.
It may sometimes be required that both the client and server need to authenticate with each other when establishing the connection. This is possible by configuring the luna client with a valid certificate file, which it presents to the luna server when negotiating TLS connection.</description>
